<p class="why"> I chose my mom because she was always the one giving me advices and being there for me to talk whenever I needed her.
My mom's always been my best friend and we always told each other everything no matter what it was.
She made a great impact on my life, I always looked up to her as I grew up and I'm so much like her.
She taught a lot of different stuff and what to do when anything happens and she would always spend hours with me on whatever I needed from her.
She always made sure I get everything right even if I failed the first time. She gave me confidence and made me a better person as I gew up and she still has a huge impact on me!</p>
